# CS 601.471/671: Self-supervised Models
## Homework 1: Text Classification with PyTorch and Word Embeddings

### Overview
In this homework, we will:
- get familiar with PyTorch and its basics
- build simple text classifiers with Pytorch for sentiment classification
- explore different word representational choices (i.e. pre-trained word embeddings) and their effects on the performance of the classifiers

### Setup
If you haven't set up Python before, we recommend using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download#downloads) to set up Python environments and manage packages.
Following the installation guide to install and initialize Anaconda on 
* [Windows](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/anaconda/install/windows/)
* [macOS](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/anaconda/install/mac-os/)
* [Linux](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/anaconda/install/linux/)

Once you have Anaconda installed, create a new environment for this homework:
```
conda create -n ssw_hw1 python=3.10.13
```
And install the required packages:
```
conda activate ssw_hw1
cd hw1
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run the code
Once you have finished each part of the homework, uncomment the corresponding lines in `main.py` to run it.

### Submission
Please follow the instructions in the homework pdf.
