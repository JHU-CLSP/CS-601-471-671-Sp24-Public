# CS 601.471/671: Self-supervised Models
## Homework 3: MLP-based Sentiment Classifier.

### Overview
In this homework, we will:
- implement MLP-based classifiers for the sentiment classification task of homework 1.
- get familiar with neural network engineering with PyTorch by exploring different configurations and hyper-parameter choices of the MLP-based classifiers.

### Setup
create a new environment for this homework:
```
conda create -n ssm_hw3 python=3.10.13
```

And install the required packages:
```
cd hw3
conda activate ssm_hw3
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run the code
Once you have finished each part of the homework, uncomment the corresponding lines in `main.py` to run it.

### Submission
Please follow the instructions in the homework pdf.
